No physical manipulators exist that expose children to programming as they do for number and alphabet systems, mechanics, art, etc.  Build a prototype for building blocks that can be attached through internal magnets, these magnets perform two actions \r\n1. physical connection and \r\n2. logical circuit connections.\r\n\r\n##Skill Requirements (Order of importance):\r\n1. System Design \r\n2. Ultra-small form factor design\r\n3. Ultra-low power/heat design (the final design would be incased in a resin\r\n4. Power and signal transmission through traditional wire & inductance\r\n\r\n##Other Details: \r\n+ IP Ownership: Joint/”none”: The goal is to release an open hardware device and software; joint ownership of the original design, publicly available for reuse under similar attribution\r\n+ Extension after End of Project: 50-100 parts run to distribute to high-needs schools as a mechanism to enhance/drive STEM as a college degree option.\r\n+ Publication Opportunities: Conference and Journal Publication both in K20 Education, IEEE Spectrum, and/or others (joint ownership: ECE team and Sponsors) [resume/CV builder!]\r\n+ No NDA required\r\n\r\n##Requirements (Wish List):\r\n\r\n###Must Have\r\n\r\n- [ ] Hardware cost <$3 per unit (average cost for a set 20 = $60)\r\n- [ ] Open Source Hardware Design & Board (can use “closed source” components: ASICs, uC, etc.)\r\n- [ ] Must Have a Multi-Chip solution – e.g. no single SoC;\r\n- [ ] Magnetic  + Inductive coupling between blocks\r\n- [ ] Fundamental grammar functioning; assignment; binary operators; \r\n- [ ] Open Software Repository (github)\r\n- [ ] Power: Ultra Low power operation\r\n- [ ] Built in power source / power pack\r\n- [ ] Separate “power” blocks?\r\n- [ ] Set of blocks for each team member and two sponsors\r\n\r\n###Like to Have\r\n- [ ] Hardware cost <$2 per unit (average cost for a set 20 = $40)\r\n- [ ] Hardware:\r\n  - [ ] Multi-function blocks – e.g. 6 (or 4) binary operators on a single block; depending on connections/which side “faces up” operation changes \r\n  - [ ] Control Structure Blocks\r\n- [ ] Set of blocks for each team member and two sponsors + 5 extra sets\r\n\r\n###Nice to Have\r\n- [ ] Hardware cost <$1 per unit (average cost for a set 20 = $20)\r\n- [ ] Power\r\n  - [ ] Built in power source w/inductance recharge\r\n- [ ] Computer GUI/Phone App: simulate a set of blocks (pre build) or take a picture of a set of blocks and execute code\r\n- [ ] Set of blocks for each team member and two sponsors + 10 extra sets (5 to sponsors; 5 to PSU)\r\n\r\n##Milestones:\r\n\r\n###Hardware Evaluation to satisfy given constraints \r\n- [ ] Main System: Modification of existing Open Hardware Design to create part or creation of custom PCB?\r\n- [ ] Power System: Battery capacity + recharge?\r\n- [ ] Communication mechanisms: Effective low cost communication and sync (without taxing power source)?\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\n- [ ] Development of full hardware solution\r\n- [ ] Development of power system\r\n- [ ] Development of communication system\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
