\section{Needs Statement}
Today's world is one of interconnected technologies, at the heart of which are devices like computers and micro-controllers. As the technological complexity of our world increases we will find our society increasingly reliant on the men and women who know how to operate and control these devices.


However as of today no universally accessible curriculum includes a focus on the knowledge and skills needed to program these machines. We have need of any system that can help children learn and understand these concepts. Additionally,  the long term effectiveness of any system will depend on both its ease of use and its accessibility across a large range of communities, especially those under financial duress.


\section{Objective}
The primary goal of this project is to create a low cost tactile teaching aid capable of helping a wide range of K-12 students learn the basics of computer programming. Our proposed teaching aid is a set of blocks that will allow students to  perform basic programming operations and assignments through the arrangement of the blocks. Verification of valid code structures will provide feedback for learning, and control of simple outputs connected to the system can give students a goal for their projects.

\section{Background}

Currently there are limited methods of teaching  younger groups of students about computer programming, and those that do exist often rely heavily on access to computers. This project is meant to produce a learning aid that will function in a classroom setting, doing away with the need to have computers present for learning about programming.
The use of a visual-tactile system to teach new skills to children has a long and well established history dating at least as far back as Froebel, who believed that freedom to play and experiment, was essential to real learning.

 In terms of this project the system can be thought of as a, Froebel \textit{Spielgaben}, or a subject specific learning module. The purpose of which, is to allow students of any age to be introduced to coding, using a familiar process that promotes creativity. Allowing the module to be untethered, separate from a computer, will also allow the teaching of programming without the other distractions available on a PC, and give students that have trouble with abstraction a set of objects to focus on.

\section{Marketing Requirements}


The final package will be a set of between twenty to thirty blocks typically two or less inches across a side. The set will function as it's own interface device, where the topographical arrangement of elements (blocks) will determine the \textit{program}. The individual blocks must be identifiable as belonging to a specific programming construct-group. At a minimum these groups must include; numbers, variables, operators, and controls.

Additionally , if possible, a block should be capable of indicating what  value or function has been  assigned to it. Blocks should be easy to assemble,  allowing users to experiment with layouts, but provide area specific error feedback, thereby increasing understanding and limiting confusion.

Finally, the set should be open source and be sufficiently accessible, both by cost and teaching use, as to promote universal access and encourage development and expansion by others.




\section{Current Proposed Solutions }
  The current solutions we propose below are subject to change, as feasibility and effectiveness will become more clear as prototyping commences. Each level of description is limited to an overview of the specific proposed method. Each subsection is intended to create enough familiarity with the method described so that we can address associated \textit{Risk Management} in section 6.

\subsection{System Overview and User Interface}
 Our product will consist of identical \textit{blocks}, each with enough digital circuitry to accomplish the following;
  \begin{enumerate} 
  \item Electrically connect with each neighboring block,up to 4 blocks. \item Connect to a global buss, carrying system power and ground.
  \item Communicate over the global bus. 
  \item Obtain or store an objective value (its token ID) for the block
  \item Control a single LED.	 
  \end{enumerate}
   The block-to-block metal nets will form a mesh grid (local communication), while the  global bus will use an I2C(or similar) protocol. We will address this network as a \textit{matrix} for the rest of this document.
  \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6in]{user_interface}
    \caption{Visual aid for section 5.1}
   \end{figure}

\vspace{.5cm}
The  \textit{\textbf{RUN}} block, or control block (see figure 1), has buttons to  force a reset or to attempt a run/ compile.  It also has LED indicators for relaying current status. It connects to the bottom most left most of the other blocks. \begin{verbatim}
<Note: the bottom is one possible configuration being considered> 
\end{verbatim}

Each programming block connects to its neighbors to form a program. The lines of  code are read from left to right, and lines are read one at a time from top to bottom. On each programming block a tunable wheel allows the user to select the meaning or \textit{value} of the block  in its \textbf{\textit{This Block}} window.  Users are given hints for which blocks ought to be placed to the left and right of the current block. Hints appear in the \textbf{\textit{Neighbors}} windows, and an LED will indicate error locality at the block whose sequence/ syntax is invalid when the program is run. 

Output blocks will have some way of acting on the world, such as a controllable light source, or a small speaker for sound. The interface to control  output is a separately connected  special \textit{output} block (not shown), which may be connected to the run/ control block.


 
  \subsection{Blocks And Communication: Software}
    Each block stores its own associated data. Each block stores a \textit{position vector}, which represents where on the matrix the block is located, and stores a \textit{unique ID}, which allows the block to be uniquely addressed on the global bus. Upon initialization, the position vector of each block is unknown.
  
   

    \subsubsection{Determining Location}
      The process for each block to identify its position vector is as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item First the positions of each block in column 1 are discovered:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The processing block passes a \begin{verbatim}<0,0>\end{verbatim} vector to its northern neighbor via the local mesh grid.
          \item Until the end of the column is reached, whenever a block receives a vector from its southern neighbor, each block increments the y component of its position vector, emits a message on the global bus containing \begin{verbatim}[position vector, unique ID]\end{verbatim}then passes its position vector to its northern neighbor.\\
          $**note$; \textit{the unique ID is generated and assigned by I2C }
          \item The last block on the column increments the y component of its position vector, then emits a message on the global bus containing \begin{verbatim}[position vector, unique ID, END_OF_DIMENSION]\end{verbatim}
        \end{enumerate}
        
      \item The processing block collects this info in its own local copy of the matrix.
      \item To identify each block in each row:
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item The processing block iterates over each Column 1 entry in its local-cache. Using the emitted Unique IDs for each entry, the processing block sends a \begin{verbatim}BEGIN_RASTER\end{verbatim}message to each Column 1 block via the global bus.
          \item When each Column 1 block receives a \begin{verbatim}BEGIN_RASTER\end{verbatim}message on the global bus, it passes its Position Vector to its eastern neighbor via the local bus.
          \item Until the end of the line is reached, whenever a block receives a vector from its western neighbor, each block increments the x component of its position vector, emits a message on the global bus containing \begin{verbatim}[position vector, unique ID]\end{verbatim}then passes its position vector to its eastern neighbor.
          \item The last block on the line increments the x component of its position vector, then emits a message on the global bus containing \begin{verbatim}[position vector, unique ID, END_OF_DIMENSION]\end{verbatim}
        \end{enumerate}
      \item Using the messages passed on the global bus, the processing block is able to fill in its local-cache with all of the Unique IDs of the blocks in the network.
      \end{enumerate}
       \begin{figure}[H]
         \centering
          \includegraphics[width=6in]{central_processor_stages}
          \caption{Flow chart for sections 5.2 through 5.3}
         \end{figure}
  \subsection{Language, Parsing, Processing}
    After filling in its local-cache, the processing block can interpret the language in a traditional manner using a Lexer, Parser, and AST-Interpreter. This all happens in software.
    \subsubsection{Lexing}
      The processor is coded with an alterable lookup table containing the token associated with each Unique ID. The lexer does a raster scan on the processors local-cache matrix, and for each Unique ID it encounters, looks up the lexical value of the ID in the lookup table. The lexer hands this token, the value found (\textit{see section 5.1 item 1 and section 5.4}) to the Parser.
    \subsubsection{Parsing}
      The parser is a traditional LR parser that constructs an abstract syntax tree from the lexical tokens handed to it by the lexer. It passes the root of the abstract syntax tree to the interpreter.
    \subsubsection{Interpretation}
      The interpreter descends the abstract syntax tree \textit{\textbf{(AST)}}, performing the actions associated with each node.
 \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
 \includegraphics[width=6in]{central_processor_interpreter}
    \caption{Flow chart for 5.3.3}
   \end{figure}
\subsection{ Visual Feedback}
Currently the scheme for allowing the user to set the  block token (see 5.3.1) to be handed to the parser involves a system of selectable visual cues on the top face of the block. A potentiometer will be attached to a coded wheel that sits under the top face of the block, with a radius such that just the edge of the wheel may be manipulated by the user through a cut out on the side face of the block (see figure 4 below).

 \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
 \includegraphics{BlkFace.png}
    \caption{Wheel Encoder Diagrams for section 5.4}
   \end{figure}

\subsubsection{I/O}
User interface by rotating the wheel to select the desired value (token), this corresponds to a number processed via Grey Code or ADC which is then sent to the lexer for lookup.

When the interpreter has finished compiling the program image, if any errors exist, the control unit identifies which unique ID holds the token that caused it and sends out on the bus;
\begin{verbatim}
[unique ID]
FLASH_LED
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Micro-controller}

\includegraphics[width=6in]{uC_State}
Once a micro-controller has determined its address, it will enable its I2C port and attach itself to the shared bus. This allows the main processor SBC to regularly poll the bus for the correct devices.
\begin{verbatim}
<Note: I2C is one possible protocol being considered>
\end{verbatim}
The diagram on the previous page assumes that the main processor \textbf{block} is oriented at the bottom-left of the code blocks and the \textbf{program} will be built up from this origin, i.e. each block receives its position vector either from below or from the left. 


This implementation allows us to utilize existing, supported, documented I2C drivers for both the micro controller in a hardware-supported and interrupt-driven slave-mode and the SBC in master-mode.

If the block is disconnected and reconnected it should return to the beginning state. This is now noted at the top by Reset.

In a 2x2 example, the block at (1, 1) would get vector signals both from the left and from below. It could simply use the first one it receives and ignore the other, or it could use the second to confirm the correct position as they should generate the same coordinate value.


Each micro-controller generates its own address from its position vector. A possible implementation is that the x-coordinate is the most significant 3 bits of the address, followed by the y-coordinate as the next 4 bits of the address, and the final bit (LSB) is the I2C R/W bit, per spec. For example, the block at position (2, 1) would have the address of: [010 0001 x]. This resolves to dimension limitations of 8 blocks long and 16 blocks tall, or a max 16 lines of code that are max 8 blocks wide. This is further limited by I2C reserved addresses. Other implementations could improve upon this.


Once the block knows its function and its position, it is immediately available for I2C addressing from the SBC. Since the I2C communication will be interrupt-driven, the block can resume setting up after it services a message if it was received before it completed initialization. Possible commands could include:
\begin{verbatim}
* Return this block's function code
* Toggle this block's error LED
* Reset this block
* Etc.
\end{verbatim}
   
\subsection{Physical Connections}
Blocks will be interlocked using small outward pegs with corresponding recessed cavities. These protrusions on the blocks will contain the electrical connectors, and serve as a physical guide to ensure the pin connections line up during product use. A combination of varying the connector types, the protrusion shapes, and magnets can be used to hold blocks firmly together and  will ensure that only the correct face of one block can be mated to a second block.\\

  \section{Risk Management}
  Identifying potential risks associated with our current proposed solutions, can help by allowing a certain amount of mitigating action to be built in to the design process. This section follows the same layout as section 5, with 6.1 being directly related to 5.1 and so on.
  \subsection{User Interface}
  In any scheme designed to be easy to use there is the danger of being easy only for the designers. What we think of as intuitive is not certain to be easy to understand for students or teachers. 
  The more complex our manuals or instructions are, the clearer it can be how to use the blocks.
  
   There is however,  a limit to how much time a  user is willing invest in reading instruction before they can use the blocks effectively . If there is not enough or too much user targeted documentation, learning to use the blocks could be frustrating.
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item \textit{Mitigation:} Both risks can be reduced by testing, and seeking feedback, which invites a trade off of time and resources spent on testing versus spent on designs and implementations. 
  \end{enumerate} 
   
 
  \subsection{Software}
    Possible pitfalls for the current proposed solution are discussed in this section, and likely mitigation techniques are discussed for each pitfall.
    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Varying path lengths on each bus may result in bit drift and/or clock skew.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Throughput on buses is not likely to be a significant factor in system performance (whereas interpreter performance is), so slower baud rates are a cheap solution.
      \end{enumerate}

%   WE DO NOT CURRENTLY ADDRESS 2 DIMENSIONAL SCANNING IN OUR PAPER, WE ONLY INTRODUCE RASTER SCANNING TECHNIQUE
%      \item Propagation of position vectoring commands along two dimensions could result in long wait times for global bus arbitration, resulting in timeouts.
%      \begin{enumerate}
%        \item
%      \end{enumerate}

      \item A user can write an infinite loop
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:}User programs will run in their own process which will be killed whenever blocks are rearranged (then the new program will start in a new process).
      \end{enumerate}

      \item Manufacturing uncertainties: Connectors do not align; enclosures are not square. Magnetic interference.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} Expose connectors for proof-of-concept revisions to demonstrate functionality.
      \end{enumerate}

      \item Communication algorithm was inherently flawed.
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} We plan to release our first revision at the halfway mark before "product launch". Reimplementing the Location-Vectoring algorithm using a tray as a fixed-grid reader of Unique IDs would be trivial from a design perspective.
      \end{enumerate}

    \end{enumerate}
   \stepcounter{subsection}
   \subsection{Visual Feedback}
   In general there is a proportional relationship between the level of detail relayed to the user and complexity. The current proposal involves several moving pieces which each represent a risk of mechanical failure. Additionally there is a hardware to software interface at each point that posses additional risks. By contrast limiting the feedback system runs the risk of making the program controls too difficult.  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Mitigation:} Use of an ID \textit{ stub} in software will help simplify testing and allow for bugs to be narrowed to either HW or SW.
      \item \textit{Mitigation:} We will remain willing to limit the number of selectable states to reduce complexity as needed.
        \item \textit{Mitigation:} First run/ prototypes may also have to use a simple dial without the encoded wheel as proof of concept.
  \end{enumerate} 
  \vfill
   \subsection{Micro-controller}
   
   Blocks may get stuck in different states. 
   \begin{enumerate}
     \item \textit{Mitigation:} Reset triggers and watchdog timers can help alleviate some issues.
   \end{enumerate} 
   Additionally the algorithm on its own does not determine end of line or completed search, the main processor block must poll regularly for block identities. This can lead to:
      \begin{verbatim}
       * Stale function values
       * Wasted processing on both ends of the bus
      \end{verbatim}
     \begin{enumerate}
      \item[2.] \textit{Mitigation:} Possible optimizations can be made by limiting poll to likely addresses (blocks starting at 0, etc)
     \end{enumerate}
  
    \subsection{Physical Connections}
    The interlocking of the blocks adds the possibility that blocks can only be inserted easily on faces that have no adjacent blocks already connected. This would mean that if the interlocking sections of blocks are tight tolerance, rows will have to be constructed prior to being connected to other rows.
    
    Additionally adding a magnetic connection to hold the blocks together makes assembly of the block more difficult. Having unique locations for each connector/interlock pair means that an incorrectly oriented magnetic internal to the device could prevent a good connection.
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item \textit{Mitigation:} Determining the tolerance between blocks will aid in the selection of an appropriate connector.
      \item \textit{Mitigation:} Use male/ female type connectors only for first pass, avoiding magnets. 
    \end{enumerate} 


\subsection{General Cautions and Considerations}
\subsubsection{Fetching Block Tokens}
When the token is selected on a block by the user(\textit{see 5.3 and 5.4}) it must be fetched by the lexer. Several solutions exist and are proposed below. The solution chosen is dependent on metrics obtained during prototyping. The following factors will be weighed when determining which block-fetch technique will be used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Required communication transactions.} Some techniques include the block token in messages already required by the location-finding algorithm, while some introduce additional messages.
    \item \textit{Token-Fetch-to-Parse Latency.} The amount of time it takes from reading the user-selected token to passing the token to the lexer is variable from technique-to-technique. This latency is a component of the overall system opacity time, eg. the time when user-changes to selected block tokens don't effect program execution. Opacity time should be reduced where possible.
    \item \textit{Determinism.} Some techniques use parallel execution which could lead to certain token-fetches to arrive at indeterminate times. This can make debugging during testing phases more difficult.
    \item \textit{Complexity.} The complexity of the algorithm chosen and the complexity of implementing the algorithm are to be considered. Algorithmic complexity makes later expansion more difficult, while implementation complexity increases development time.
\end{enumerate}

The following block-token-fetching techniques will be considered, and their consideration of the above factors are included:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{Reading and sending block-tokens during location-scanning time.} Least amount of communication, most token-fetch-to-parse latency, deterministic, least complexity.
    \item \textit{Fetch during lex time.} Adds a message transaction for each block, minimum token-fetch-to-parse latency, deterministic, slightly more complex.
    \item \textit{Regular polling in asynchronus thread from lexing.} Increases the amount of messages by indeterminate amount, indeterminate token-fetch-to-parse latency, non-deterministic, complex implementation but least complex algorithmically.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Open Sourcing }
To stay on track with developing an open source platform, we want to reduce actions that might lead to complications.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item \textit{Mitigation:} avoid dependence on non-generic components
\item \textit{Mitigation:} avoid, where possible, proprietary technologies.
\item \textit{Mitigation:}always check licensing
  \end{enumerate}
